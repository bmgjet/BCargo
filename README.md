<p><strong>BCargo</strong><br /> Blocks Cargoship from leaving while it is within a blocked area.<br /> Allows to set a static spawn position for the cargo to stop it running though islands on its way into the nearest path node or to have it come down a river<br /> Add support for auto leveling of cargo when using tides plugin to stop it sinking below water level or flying in the air.<br /> <br /> <strong>How to use:</strong><br /> Join your server and add some blocking nodes.<br />This is done by typing <strong>/bcargo add</strong><br />It will add a blocking node where your player currently is and with a radius thats been set by LeaveBlockDistance value (default is 120)</p>
<p>You can remove blocking nodes with the command <strong>/bcargo remove 0</strong><br />That will remove the last node placed. Using a number of the node instead of 0 will remove the selected node.<br /><br />You can view the cargos default path by typing <strong>/bcargo view</strong><br />This will show default path nodes as blue and your blocking nodes as red.<br /><br /></p>

Then type <strong>/bcargo spawn</strong> and it will set that as its static spawn location.<br />You can enable/disable use of this manual spawn spots with the command <strong>/bcargo spawn on</strong> or <strong>/bcargo spawn off</strong><br /> <br /> If you are using the tides plugin you will have the issue of the cargoship stays at the same height as when it spawned. This means it will sink under water if it spawned at low tide. Or fly in the air if it spawned at high tide.<br /> Enabling this function will allow it to auto reheight as its traveling its path.<br /> ( "Enable auto leveling for tides plugin : "true,)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Once you are happy with the node path you have set out for blocking use the command</span><br /><strong>/bcargo save</strong><br />to save all changes you have made.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Permissions: (Needed for chat commands)</strong><br /> BCargo.admin<br /> <br /> <strong>Chat commands:</strong><br />/bcargo help&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- Will show a list of commands and there description.</p>
