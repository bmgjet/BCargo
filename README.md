<p><strong>BCargo</strong><br /> Blocks Cargoship from leaving while it is within a building blocked area.<br /> Allows to set a static spawn position for the cargo to stop it running though islands on its way into the nearest path node or to have it come down a river<br /> Add support for auto leveling of cargo when using tides plugin to stop it sinking below water level or flying in the air.<br /> <br /> <strong>How to use:</strong><br /> In your map editor. Stretch out some prevent building cubes along the part of the path you dont want cargo ship to exit on.<br /> It will continue along its path until its X distance from the prevent building cube before it leaves to the nearest edge.<br /> This stops it just running though the land and destroying any buildings on its way to the edge.</p>

Then type <strong>/setbcargo</strong> and it will set that as its static spawn location.<br /> Then enable the function within the config json file.<br /> ("Override random cargo spawn point : ": true,)<br /> <br /> If you are using the tides plugin you will have the issue of the cargoship stays at the same height as when it spawned. This means it will sink under water if it spawned at low tide. Or fly in the air if it spawned at high tide.<br /> Enabling this function will allow it to auto reheight as its traveling its path.<br /> ( "Enable auto leveling for tides plugin : ": true,)<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Permissions: (Needed for chat commands)</strong><br /> BCargo.admin<br /> <br /> <strong>Chat commands:</strong><br /> /setbcargo = Sets cargoship to spawn to players current location instead of random offshore location.<br /> /reloadbcargo = Reloads the json config file.</p>
